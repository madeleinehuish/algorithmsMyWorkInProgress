Madeleine's Algorithm Bookshelf

Many of these started as exercises with Stephen's Grider's excellent algorithm course. I didn't always solve the problems as he did. I've also added different exercises and algorithm problems from many sources, oftentimes modifying or working out the code myself. So this folder is really a mix of my own and others work. My current work in progress with algorithms...
Most of the folders have tests (written mostly in jest).
